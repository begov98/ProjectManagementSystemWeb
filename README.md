# Project management system application

## Welcome
Hi there! :)

This is my first functional ASP.NET MVC project and actually my coursework project for the C# Web development course in SoftUni. It is a simple application for managing projects and their subtasks. 

Best regards, 
P. Begov

## Get started

You just shall create the database. (the uploaded connection string in appsetings.json will create database named "ProjectManagementSystem"
To login into the default admin user you shall use:

Username: **pmsadmin** 

Password: **Admin123**

**The default roles are:**

(Manager) -> Full access to everything. Only with this role you are able to create new Project. Only he can re-assign Project managers from/to Projects. Can edit/delete the projects.
This role shall be for the Manager/Head of the department. :)

(ProjectManager) -> Can create tasks in the project for which he is assigned to. Can assign users to the tasks in his Project. Can edit/delete the tasks.
This role shall be for the Project managers who will manage the Projects.

(Specialists) -> These are the guys who will work on the tasks and will share their progress in the comment section in each Task.
